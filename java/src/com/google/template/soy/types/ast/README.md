This directory contains the type AST.  This AST is generated by the JavaCC
parser, and represents the raw type tokens that form a declared type. It does no
validation that any of the types make sense (beyond basic syntax); names are
only resolved later.

`SoyTypeRegistry` can be used to convert a `TypeNode` to a concrete `SoyType`
instance usable for actual type logic.  It will report errors (eg, unknown type
names, or missing generic arguments) to its `ErrorReporter`.

The type AST is completely separate from the Soy nodes in the older soytree
package; this AST is fully immutable, and heavily inspired by
[Roslyn](http://roslyn.io).  Type ASTs are exposed by properties in `HeaderParam` (for
parameters).  However, they should rarely be used directly; instead, use the resolved `SoyType`s.
