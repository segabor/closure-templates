// Additional metadata to be included with a loggable element. Extend this and
// set the metadata in your logging config. Note that metadata will be
// serialized in JS and sent to the client, so copious metadata could bloat JS
// size. To keep JS code size down, we recommend using smart defaults for
// metadata (so metadata only has to be sent to the client if the value is
// different than the default) and only setting the metadata on a VE if that
// metadata is different from the default.
