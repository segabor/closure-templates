# Creating a Custom Plugin

Soy allows users to write functions that templates can call. This is useful for
when there is some logic that is difficult or impossible to express using Soy
language features. Soy actually has a number of these built in. For example, the
`mapKeys` function which can be used to get the keys of a map for iteration.

```soy
{template .foo}
  {@param m: map<string, string>}
  {for $key in mapKeys($m)}
    Key: {$key}, Value: {$m[$key]}
  {/for}
{/template}
```

However, it isn't possible for Soy to supply all possible desired functionality
so Soy allows users to supply custom plugin function definitions.

## When to define a custom function

Soy functions are a fairly powerful feature, but they aren't always the best
option. This is because:

*   You need to write distinct implementations for all languages (JS, Java,
    Python) that you are compiling your templates for and ensuring consistent
    behavior can be difficult.
*   The registration mechanism is cumbersome.
*   It is difficult to produce `SanitizedContent` from a plugin, so they are a
    poor fit for generating `html` `css` or `JavaScript`

So in general if you can represent your functionality using a shared template
you should do so. However, they are sometimes quite necessary. Some good
usecases include:

*   Custom date or number formatting
*   Complex math functions
*   Date calculations
*   Filtering, sorting or aggregating datastructures
*   ...

All of the above are difficult or impossible to implement in a plain template.
For these reasons Soy allows for users to write custom functions.

## How do I create a `SoySourceFunction`?

### 1. Define the signature `SoySourceFunction`

For example, let's assume you wanted to have a function called `uniqueId()` that
returns a unique number. This might be useful for generating DOM ids. You would
start by defining a `SoyFunction` subtype:

```java
@SoyFunctionSignature(
    name = "uniqueId",
    value = @Signature(returnType="string"))
class UniqueIdFunction implements SoySourceFunction {}
```

This tells the compiler basic information for your function (name and arity),
however we don't yet have any implementations that would tell the compiler how
to generate code for this function.

### 2. Define the logic

Depending on what backends you care about, you can also have your function
implement any of the following interfaces:

1.  `SoyJavaScriptSourceFunction` for generating JS code
1.  `SoyJavaSourceFunction` for generating Java bytecode
1.  `SoyPySrcFunction` for generating Python code
1.  _experimental_ `LoggingFunction` for interacting with a `SoyLogger`. See the
    [doc-logging](doc-logging#logging_function) guide for more information

For example, if you wanted to have an implementation for both Java and JS you
would implement both those interfaces and write something like

```java
@SoyFunctionSignature(
    name = "uniqueId",
    value = @Signature(returnType="string"))
public class UniqueIdFunction implements
    SoyJavaSourceFunction, SoyJavaScriptSourceFunction {
  private static final AtomicLong counter = new AtomicLong();

  public static String nextId() {
    return "id-" + counter.incrementAndGet();
  }

  private static final Method NEXT_ID =
      JavaValueFactory.createMethod(UniqueIdFunction.class, "nextId");

  @Override
  public JavaValue applyForJavaSource(
      JavaValueFactory factory, List<JavaValue> args, JavaPluginContext context) {
    return factory.callStaticMethod(NEXT_ID);
  }

  @Override
  public JavaScriptValue applyForJavaScriptSource(
     JavaScriptValueFactory factory, List<JavaScriptValue> args, JavaScriptPluginContext context) {
    // Note: If the library isn't provided by goog.module, use callNamespaceFunction instead.
    return factory.callModuleFunction("some.js.lib", "uniqueId");
  }
}
```

Given this implementation, the `applyForJavaSource` method will invoked by the
compiler to generate Java bytecode to call the "nextId" method for server-side
rendering, and the `computeForJsSrc` method will be invoked by the compiler to
generate JS code for client-side rendering (the implementation will call the
given JS library function).

If the Java implementation needs any non-static dependencies at runtime (e.g, a
`NextIdService`), the `applyForJavaSource` method can use
`JavaValueFactory.callInstanceMethod`.For rendering to work, the instance the
plugin will use must be passed to the `SoySauce` or `SoyTofu` constructor, or if
that is impossible the Renderer's `setPluginInstances` method. For example,

```java
@SoyFunctionSignature(
    name = "uniqueId",
    value = @Signature(returnType="string"))
public class UniqueIdFunction implements
    SoyJavaSourceFunction, SoyJavaScriptSourceFunction {

  private static final Method NEXT_ID =
      JavaValueFactory.createMethod(NextIdService.class, "nextId");

  @Override
  public JavaValue applyForJavaSource(
      JavaValueFactory factory, List<JavaValue> args, JavaPluginContext context) {
    return factory.callInstanceMethod(NEXT_ID);
  }

  @Override
  JavaScriptValue applyForJavaScriptSource(
     JavaScriptValueFactory factory, List<JavaScriptValue> args, JavaScriptPluginContext context) {
    // Note: If the library isn't provided by goog.module, use callNamespaceFunction instead.
    return factory.callModuleFunction("some.js.lib", "uniqueId");
  }
}

class NextIdService {
  private final AtomicLong counter = new AtomicLong();

  public String nextId() {
    return "id-" + counter.incrementAndGet();
  }
}
```

Once you are satisfied with the implementation, you would register it with the
compiler.

#### Contextual data available to plugins

For Java, JavaPluginContext provides some contextual data.

*   getULocale

    Provides the current locale being used for rendering, as a
    `com.ibm.icu.util.ULocale`.

### 3. Register your plugin with the compiler

All SoySourceFunctions (e.g, `SoyJavaSourceFunction`) must be passed to the
compiler via the `--pluginFunctions` flag. The flag takes a comma separated list
of the fully qualified class name of the function. You will also need to make
sure that the class is on the compiler's classpath.

Google users should use the `af_soy_plugin` build rule to register their
plugins. See go/af-soy/build_rules#af-soy-plugin-and-af-soy-legacy-plugin

### 4. Use It!

At this point, you can start calling your new plugin function from your
templates. For example:

```soy
{template .foo}
  {let $id : uniqueId() /}
  <div id={$id}>
    Some content
  </div>
  ...
  <a href="#{$id}">Scroll up</a>
{/template}
```

When rendered server side, the methods referenced in `applyForJavaSource` will
be invoked. If `applyForJavaSource` used `callInstanceMethod`, the instance
classes must be supplied to `SoySauce` or `Tofu` constructor (or
`Renderer.setPluginInstances` if the former is infeasible). When compiled for
JS, the compiler will output a `goog.require('some.js.lib');` and invoke
`some.js.lib.uniqueId()` for each call to `uniqueId()`.


## More about SoyFunctionSignature...

All types that are understandable by Soy compiler will be supported in the
annotation.

Some plugins might behave differently when the input size changes. It is
possible to define some overloads in the function signature annotation:

```java
@SoyFunctionSignature(
  name = "foo",
  value = {
    @Signature(
      parameterTypes = {"string"},
      returnType = "int"
    ),
    @Signature(
      parameterTypes = {"string", "string"},
      returnType = "string"
    )})
class FooFunction implements SoySourceFunction {}
```

There are some restrictions to this annotation. First, it does not support
overloads that have the same amount of arguments. Second, generic overloads are
unsupported. It is impossible to say this function will return `T` when the
input is `list<T>`.


## Pure functions {#pure}

Soy can sometimes optimize a function if the function is marked as "pure". A
pure function is one that is idempotent, if it's called multiple times with the
same arguments it will always return the same thing. An example of a pure
function would be a function that takes two lists as parameters and returns the
lists concatenated together (always in the same order). An example of a non-pure
function would be a function that keeps track of and returns how many times it's
been called.

To mark a function as pure annotate it with
[`SoyPureFunction`](https://github.com/google/closure-templates/blob/master/java/src/com/google/template/soy/shared/restricted/SoyPureFunction.java).

## Custom print directives, deprecated and not recommended

Soy also allows the creation of custom print directives, for example, in
`{$foo|truncate:100}` `truncate` is a print directive.

The method for authoring and configuring print directives is nearly identical to
configuring a custom function (described above). However, it is no longer
recommended for projects to create these. All the usecases for a custom print
directive can be satisfied by a custom function and the syntax/behavior of those
is more intuitive.

### Migrating print directives to functions {#migrate}

Soy print directives are deprecated and it is recommended to convert your print
directives to functions. The Soy team will gradually do the same for built-in
print directives.

If your print directive is used in only a few places it may be feasible to
convert your print directive and update all the templates that use it in one CL.
This is the simplest option.

If your print directive is used widely and you can't update all templates at
once Soy provides features to help you migrate from print directives to
functions. Follow the following steps for each print directive:

1.  Rewrite the print directive as a `SoySourceFunction`.
    1.  Give the function the same name as the print directive (without the
        leading `|`)
    1.  A function takes one more parameter than the equivalent print directive.
        Do not make any other changes to the number, order, or type of
        parameters.
    1.  In the `@SoyFunctionSignature` annotation set
        `callableAsDeprecatedPrintDirective = true`. This will allow the new
        function to be called from a template as either a print directive or a
        function.
    1.  Remove the print directive from the plugin bundle and add the new
        function.
    1.  Submit the above changes as a single CL.
1.  In any number of follow up changes, convert all templates that invoke the
    function via print directive syntax (`|`) to invoke the function with call
    syntax.
1.  Once all templates have been updated remove
    `callableAsDeprecatedPrintDirective` from the function signature.

Warning: Print directives can be chained in a Soy expression. Calling a function
(with `callableAsDeprecatedPrintDirective = true`) with print directive syntax
is only supported when the print directive is the first in the chain, or if all
preceding directives are also functions with
`callableAsDeprecatedPrintDirective = true`.
